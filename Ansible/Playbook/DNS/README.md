This playbook will first create a backup of the hosts file, then remove the DNS entries specified in the dns_entries variable and then adding the new entries. Finally, it will check if the entries are properly added and show the content in the debug section.

You need to run this playbook with ansible-playbook command and provide the inventory file where the target hosts are specified.

Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventoryfile.ini yourplaybook.yml
Also, make sure that you have proper ssh access to the target host and the necessary permissions to edit the hosts file.
